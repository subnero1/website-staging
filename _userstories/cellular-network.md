    <p>The need for seamless underwater communication is growing rapidly as the number of subsea assets increases. From autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) performing offshore inspections to divers conducting critical missions, continuous communication and tracking are essential for safety, efficiency, and mission success.</p>
    <p>To address this, Subnero, in collaboration with ST Engineering Unmanned & Integrated Systems (ST UIS), have successfully deployed one of the world’s first underwater cellular networks in Singapore waters, demonstrating continuous coverage, seamless mobility, multi-user resource sharing, and real-time tracking of subsea assets. This deployment validates the architecture that will form the backbone of the Internet of the Oceans: the next frontier in global connectivity.</p>
    <div class="highlight-text">
      <p>“Oceans cover 70% of the planet but remain 99% disconnected. Subnero’s mission is to change that &mdash; by building the Internet of the Oceans.”</p>

    <h2>Network Architecture</h2>
    <div class="float-aside">
      <h2>Why Underwater Cellular Networks Matter?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Supports multi-asset missions</li>
          <li>Enhanced operations; less downtime</li>
          <li>Enables autonomous subsea fleets</li>
          <li>Enhances safety for divers and vessels</li>
          <li>Unlocks persistent subsea IoT</li>
          <li>Scales like terrestrial networks: add more cells → expand coverage</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>The network test bed was established using navigational buoys equipped with Subnero’s acoustic smart modems, forming subsea base stations. These buoys created overlapping coverage areas, much like cellular towers on land.</p>
    <ul class="list-normal">
      <li>A three-base-station network was deployed in Singapore waters.</li>
      <li>Underwater assets (e.g. AUVs) equipped with Subnero modems served as the mobile assets utilizing the network.</li>
      <li>A central network controller coordinated the system, enabling communication, handovers, and tracking.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This setup enabled continuous two-way communication between subsea assets, the AUVs and the topside controller, while also providing real-time location tracking whenever the vehicle was within range of three or more base stations.</p>

    <h2>Testbed Trials</h2>
    <ol class="list-normal">
      <li>A three-buoy underwater network testbed using Subnero modems was deployed to evaluate cellular-style subsea communication in real conditions.</li>
      <li>AUVs moved between coverage zones and demonstrated seamless handover, maintaining links to the controller.</li>
      <li>Both communication performance (packet transmission, command & control, telemetry) and localization accuracy were monitored.</li>
      <li>The tests were performed jointly by Subnero and ST UIS, demonstrating the system’s ability to maintain seamless connectivity and location awareness.</li>
    </ol>
