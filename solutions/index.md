## Underwater communications & networking

Our underwater modem provides a flexible platform for a variety of underwater networks and applications. With substantial computing power packed into a compact form factor, users are able to implement and deploy complex algorithms in the modem, hence allowing robust communication between underwater nodes as well as driving the innovation of new protocols and applications. Powered by UnetStack, a flexible agent-based underwater network stack, the modems provide options for customization and extension at many levels, allowing network protocols as well as physical layer algorithms to be implemented and tested easily.

Our modems are available in many configurations that cater for different application needs. The _surface configuration_ is ideally suited for gateway nodes in an underwater network, connecting the underwater network to wired or wireless networks (e.g. 3G/4G, WiFi, satellite) above water. The _node configuration_ modems come as standalone packages with their own batteries. These are typically deployed in the water column or on the seabed, and can act as network routers, repeaters and beacons. The _embedded configuration_ modems are compact OEM devices that are designed for integration into Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and underwater sensors, allowing the AUVs and sensors to be connected. Once in the water, the different configuration modems seamlessly integrate into a single underwater communication network.

Our modems are also available in several editions. The _silver edition_ modems are robust communication devices, typically suited for most standard commercial deployments. The lower-cost _research edition_ modems provide a flexible tool that allows students, researchers and hobbyists to develop and test underwater networks. The _platinum edition_ modems use components that are designed for extended range of operating conditions, and undergo extensive environmental testing. They are best suited for applications in harsh environmental conditions or increased level of robustness.

## Underwater navigation

Our underwater modems can not only be used for communication, but also for underwater navigation. They can be used for acoustic ranging, and to form a GPS-like infrastructure underwater, aiding underwater vehicles in self-localization as well as communication. The nodes can be used as beacons for position estimation and can transparently relay information. This allows vehicles to navigate accurately as well as communicate over long distances to other vehicles, underwater installations and/or surface nodes. These nodes may be easily dropped into water in an area of operation. Once in water, the nodes self-organize into an Underwater Positioning Network (UPN). This network can then be accessed by AUVs and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) to estimate their location, navigate and communicate effectively.

## In-water monitoring & sensing

To safeguard and manage freshwater resources, effective spatial and temporal water sampling techniques are needed. Typical manual sampling used by environmental and water utility agencies is very labor-intensive and usually too sparse to capture contamination events in a timely manner. Fixed sensing buoys are able to provide real-time data but incapable of providing spatial coverage. Traditionally available AUVs are able to provide spatial coverage, but are economically and logistically expensive to operate.

The [Subnero Water Assessment Network]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link products/swan.md %}) (SWAN) contains scalable, minimally propelled autonomous platforms that can carry in-situ water quality probes and operate with minimal manual support. These mobile nodes are equipped with navigation, sensing and real-time data transmission capabilities. They can autonomously execute missions provided by users and perform vertical profiling of the water column at points of interest. Users are then able to access the data and refine missions in real-time.

We provide professional deployment services and operational support for its clients.
