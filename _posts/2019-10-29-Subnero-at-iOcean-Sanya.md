Subnero was delighted to be with [Wuxi Smartsea Technology](http://www.smartseatech.com/en/index.aspx){:target="_blank"} at iOceans 19 conference.

The event took place from the 25th to the 27th of October, in Sanya, China.

This is Subnero's first exhibition in China, with their new business partner.

We are confident that this is the beginning of a long and successful partnership in China.

Both Subnero and Wuxi Smartsea Technology will be present at Oceans 2020, in Singapore.
