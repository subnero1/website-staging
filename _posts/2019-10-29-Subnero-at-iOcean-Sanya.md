Subnero participated alongside Wuxi Smartsea Technology Co. Ltd. at the iOceans 2019 conference, held from 25–27 October in Sanya, China. This marked Subnero’s first exhibition in China with its newly appointed business partner, providing an opportunity to introduce our technologies to the local market. We see this as an important first step toward building a long-term and successful collaboration in China. Both Subnero and Wuxi Smartsea Technology were also scheduled to be present at OCEANS 2020 in Singapore.
