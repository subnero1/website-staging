**Singapore, December 11, 2025** – [Subnero Pte Ltd](https://subnero.com/) today announced a breakthrough milestone for global maritime technology. The company has successfully deployed and demonstrated an underwater cellular network in Singapore waters, delivered in partnership with [ST Engineering Unmanned & Integrated Systems (ST UIS)](https://www.stengg.com/en/defence/sea/unmanned-solutions/). It represents one of the world’s earliest commercial implementations of a subsea network designed to provide continuous coverage, seamless mobility and real time tracking for subsea assets. This work forms the foundation of what Subnero calls the Internet of the Oceans.

With the acceleration in offshore energy exploration and operations, in-water robotics, defence operations and ocean research, the need for a reliable, scalable and mobile underwater communication fabric is becoming critical. Traditional underwater acoustic systems have been limited to short distances or point-to-point links. This deployment shows that underwater networks can now behave like terrestrial cellular systems and support multiple mobile and stationary assets as they move through the mission area, enabling the next wave of scale in traditionally complex subsea operations.

### Bringing Terrestrial Cellular Network Principles to the Depths

The deployment consisted of three buoy-mounted Subnero M25M-series smart modems that acted as subsea base stations. Each buoy created a ‘cell’ with planned overlap, similar to traditional terrestrial radio network planning. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and underwater sensors equipped with Subnero M25M-series modems for communications were able to remain connected while moving between the cells. The network supported two-way communication, command and control messaging, telemetry exchange and real time localization and tracking – exhibiting terrestrial mobile network principles, applied underwater.

### Key Technical Outcomes

Across multiple trials, the network delivered three major results.

1. **Continuous Communication** Assets maintained uninterrupted links while transitioning between coverage zones. This mirrors how mobile devices switch between terrestrial towers.

2. **Continuous Tracking and Situational Awareness** Real time positional updates were available whenever assets were covered by multiple base stations, similar to multi-point localization techniques used in terrestrial networks. This allows safer and more coordinated underwater operations.

3. **Scalable and Flexible Architecture** The system demonstrated that adding more base stations naturally extends coverage and capacity. This enables large scale subsea communication grids across ports, naval bases, offshore installations and research zones.

### Unlocking New Possibilities for the Subsea Economy

The deployment represents a significant step toward a connected ocean. AUVs, divers, long duration sensors and marine robots can now operate within a shared, persistent and intelligent communication fabric.

### A First Look at the Internet of the Oceans: Why It Matters

This type of network has never been deployed at commercial scale in Asia, and it positions Singapore as a global pioneer in connected-ocean infrastructure. Singapore becomes one of the first countries to operate an underwater communication system with cellular style behaviour. This positions the region as an innovation hub for the next wave of ocean technology and autonomous maritime systems.
