Subnero Pte Ltd had a very successful exhibition at Imdex Asia 2019, in Singapore.
The exhibition took place from Tuesday 14th of May to Thursday 16th of May, at the Changi Exhibition Center, in Singapore.
During the first 2 days, our kiosk was busy with visitors from several different countries. 
All our visitors showed real interest in our technology and were enthusiastic when we talked about our future projects.
The last day saw us winning the What's Next pitching session competition.
What a way to finish an exhibition!
