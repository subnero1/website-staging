OCEANS is a biennial event that brings together marine technologists, engineers, scientists, students, policymakers, and professionals from around the world. Over four days, participants explore key topics and emerging trends while building a global community that advances research, practice, and policy in the marine domain.

The conference is jointly organized by the [Marine Technology Society](https://www.mtsociety.org/) and the [IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society](http://ieeeoes.org/), and typically attracts more than 2,000 attendees from industry, academia, and government.

Subnero participates in OCEANS every year, using the event to engage with the community and stay connected with the latest industry developments. This year, we supported John Potter’s tutorial on JANUS and demonstrated JANUS capabilities using UnetStack3. Our booth saw strong engagement throughout the exhibition.

We look forward to OCEANS 2020 in Singapore.
