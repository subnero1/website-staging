For the second consecutive year, the Subnero team participated in a virtual workshop organized by the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering of the National Institute of Technology Karnataka](https://cse.nitk.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}.

The workshop aimed to introduce participants to the fundamentals of underwater communications, the design of underwater network topologies, and the use of UnetStack for simulation and experimentation.

On Wednesday, 16 December, [Dr Shiraz Shahabudeen](https://subnero.com/people/shiraz/) delivered an overview of underwater communications, followed by a session from Florie Mancel on Subnero modems and solutions. On Thursday, 17 December, [Dr Prasad Anjangi](https://subnero.com/people/prasad/) presented on underwater protocol layers.

The presentations were well received and prompted active discussions and questions from participants. Please [contact us](https://subnero.com/contact/){:target="_blank"} if you would like to learn more about the workshop content.
