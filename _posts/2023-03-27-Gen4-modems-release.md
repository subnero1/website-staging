Singapore-based company Subnero has launched its fourth-generation Wireless Networked Communication (WNC) series of underwater acoustic modems. 

The upgraded devices provide best-in-class communication performance in any given environment, advanced networking and localization capabilities, and developer tools to simplify the development and deployment of underwater wireless networks. This launch is the culmination of our continuous effort to improve and innovate. We have listened closely to customer feedback and learned valuable insights that have been incorporated into the fourth generation of the WNC product series.

The M25M series offers up to 15<sup>*</sup> kbps and more than 4 km of communication range, while the upcoming S40H series provides up to 33<sup>*</sup> kbps and over 1 km of range in challenging conditions. These devices feature the latest iteration of UnetStack - UnetStack4 to bring the latest generation of Software-Defined Open Architecture Modems (SDOAM) to the market. The devices provide ease of integration with unified interfaces, APIs in multiple programming languages (Java, Groovy, Julia, Python, C JavaScript), OS/hardware platform independence, and support for external sensors, such as GPS and AHRS, as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) readiness for edge computing applications.

The advanced networking and localization capabilities include operating multiple communication nodes simultaneously, support for multi-hop links, routing protocols, mesh networks, cellular-like networks for broader coverage, and remote control of devices out-of-the-box.

Subnero's WNC series of underwater acoustic modems are ideal for various applications, including underwater sensors, marine robotics, diver communication networks, and underwater wireless networks. The [Subnero Wireless Integrated Suite (SWIS) - ADCP Edition](https://subnero.com/solutions/swis){:target="_blank"}, provides a seamless end-to-end solution for wireless data transfer from Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) to avoid uncertainties during long-term deployments. Ripple is a software package that provides a single software interface to all communication devices, both above and underwater on your underwater vehicle, be it wireless or wired.

Scientific researchers can benefit from the Subnero WNC series of products, which support arbitrary waveform transmission and reception, along with the ability to customize or replace every layer in the network stack. The community edition of UnetStack is free for non-commercial use, making it an ideal choice for scientific researchers.

For commercial users, the Subnero WNC series of devices offer exceptional communication performance in all environments. They also support a wide variety of subsea sensors, software ecosystems for marine robotics, deep sleep states for long deployments and in-field reconfigurability and adaptability with communication profiles. These features make Subnero WNC the go-to product series for any marine, subsea & offshore deployments.
