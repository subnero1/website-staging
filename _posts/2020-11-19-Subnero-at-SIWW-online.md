Due to the pandemic, the [Singapore International Water Week](https://www.siww.com.sg/){:target="_blank"} was postponed to July 2021, prompting the organizers to host a virtual edition instead. Subnero participated with a virtual booth, with team members available online throughout the event to engage with visitors and respond to queries. We also showcased details of our [underwater modems](https://subnero.com/products){:target="_blank"} for underwater data collection applications. The virtual show was well attended and featured several insightful talks. We looked forward to the exhibition taking place in person from 20–24 June 2021.
