Due to the pandemic, [Singapore International Water Week](https://www.siww.com.sg/){:target="_blank"} has been postponed to July 2021. 
Instead of waiting until then, the organizers arranged a virtual show.

Subnero had a virtual booth with personnel available online, permanently, to attend any visitors' queries.

We also displayed the details of our [underwater modems](https://subnero.com/products), that can be used for water data collection underwater.

The show was very well attended and had a number of very interested talks.

We are looking forward for the exhibition to take place, in person (hopefully), on the 20th - 24th of June 2021.
