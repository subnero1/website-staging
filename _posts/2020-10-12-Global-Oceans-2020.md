Due to the pandemic, the physical Oceans 2020 Singapore conference and exhibition have been postponed to 2024.

To make sure that we don’t miss the exciting new papers and stay up to date with the latest development, the IEEE OES decided to combine Oceans Singapore and US Gulf coast into a single virtual event: Global Oceans 2020.

The Subnero team was very pleased to deliver a tutorial about practical underwater software-defined network. The team talked about the fundamentals of underwater communications and networking, and many practical tools and techniques to solve common challenges. In the hands-on sessions, participants were able to try out the demos themselves using the freely available [UnetStack](https://subnero.com/products/unet.html){:target="_blank"} networking stack and simulator.

The tutorial was delivered virtually as a series of six videos:
- Part 1 – Introduction to underwater networks  
- Part 2 – Getting started with UnetStack  
- Part 3 – Multi-hop links  
- Part 4 – Sensors and the Internet  
- Part 5 – Localization  
- Part 6 – Summary and conclusion  

Slides, code samples, and additional information are available [here](https://subnero.com/oceans20){:target="_blank"}.

The videos are also available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnqY-RltGuGVwN6dFu_Z7zva17lMj7LPG){:target="_blank"}.

We received positive feedback from participants, which led to several engaging discussions. We look forward to meeting the community again in person.
