Due to the pandemic, the physical :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} conference and exhibition were postponed to 2024.

To ensure continued access to new research and developments, the :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} combined OCEANS Singapore and the US Gulf Coast editions into a single virtual event: :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

The Subnero team delivered a tutorial on practical underwater software-defined networking. The session covered fundamentals of underwater communications and networking, along with practical tools and techniques to address common challenges. During the hands-on sessions, participants were able to run demonstrations using the freely available [UnetStack](https://subnero.com/products/unet.html) networking stack and its [simulator](https://subnero.com/unetstack/unetsim).

The tutorial was delivered virtually as a series of six videos:
- Part 1 – Introduction to underwater networks  
- Part 2 – Getting started with UnetStack  
- Part 3 – Multi-hop links  
- Part 4 – Sensors and the Internet  
- Part 5 – Localization  
- Part 6 – Summary and conclusion  

Slides, code samples, and additional information are available [here](https://subnero.com/oceans20).

The videos are also available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnqY-RltGuGVwN6dFu_Z7zva17lMj7LPG).

We received positive feedback from participants, which led to several engaging discussions. We look forward to meeting the community again in person.
