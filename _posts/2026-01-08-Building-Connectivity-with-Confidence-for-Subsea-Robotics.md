For many subsea robotics developers, acoustic communication has often been viewed as a fragile necessity—something that is "nice to have" but rarely trusted to "just work." We believe it is time to close the gap between skepticism and reliability.

In a new two-part series on the Unet Blog, we break down exactly how to move from uncertain links to robust, mission-critical connectivity. Based on real-world deployments, this series offers a practical roadmap for AUV operators and engineers. It guides you through five levels of confidence, ensuring your vehicle’s acoustic link is dependable enough to provide reliable connectivity.

* **Part 1: The Foundations** We cover the essential "don'ts and do's" of acoustic systems, focusing on smart Technology Choices, rigorous Integration Hygiene (mechanical, electrical, and software), and effective Deployment Planning to avoid common environmental traps.

* **Part 2: The Advanced Edge** We explore how to make your systems more aware through Adaptive Communication Links that adjust modulation in real-time and Adaptive Command & Control, where the vehicle proactively changes behavior to maintain connectivity.

Whether you are designing a new AUV or looking to improve the reliability of your current fleet, this series provides the technical insights needed to make acoustics work for you, not against you.
