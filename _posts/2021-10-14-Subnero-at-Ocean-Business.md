Subnero returned to in-person exhibitions at Ocean Business 2021 in Southampton, UK, marking our first physical event participation in nearly two years. The exhibition was held at the National Oceanography Centre from 12–14 October 2021, following a postponement from April due to the pandemic. It was a welcome opportunity for the team to reconnect with the community and discuss our technology face to face. We enjoyed being part of the event and looked forward to the next in-person exhibition at [Oceanology International 2022](https://www.oceanologyinternational.com/london/en-gb.html){:target="_blank"} in London in March 2022.
