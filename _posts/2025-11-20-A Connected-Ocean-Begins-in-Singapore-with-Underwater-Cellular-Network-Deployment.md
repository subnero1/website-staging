**Singapore, November 20, 2025** – [Subnero Pte Ltd](https://subnero.com/) announced the successful demonstration of an underwater cellular network in Singapore waters, delivered in collaboration with [ST Engineering Unmanned & Integrated Systems (ST UIS)](https://www.stengg.com/en/defence/sea/unmanned-solutions/). The deployment showcases one of the earliest commercial testbeds designed to bring continuous coverage, seamless mobility, and real-time tracking to subsea operations—setting the foundation for what Subnero calls the Internet of the Oceans.

As subsea missions become more complex, the need for a communication fabric that behaves like terrestrial networks is growing rapidly. AUV fleets, divers, subsea sensors, and long-term monitoring assets all require persistent connectivity and the ability to move freely across operational areas without losing contact. This deployment demonstrates that such an underwater communication fabric is now achievable.

The network testbed consisted of three buoy-mounted Subnero acoustic smart modems acting as subsea base stations, forming overlapping coverage zones much like cellular towers. Underwater assets equipped with Subnero modems, including AUVs, were able to remain connected while moving between cells, with the network supporting two-way communication, command and control, telemetry exchange, and positional updates.

_“Oceans cover 70% of the planet but remain 99% disconnected. Subnero’s mission is to change that — by building the Internet of the Oceans,” said Manu Ignatius, CEO of Subnero.“_

This deployment shows that underwater networks can now behave like terrestrial ones, enabling seamless, multi-asset connectivity even in Singapore’s challenging shallow-water conditions.”

Across multiple trials, the network showcased three major outcomes:
* Continuous Communication – Stable links were maintained across the testbed, with assets able to move between base-station cells while retaining uninterrupted connectivity, similar to how mobile devices switch between terrestrial towers.
* Continuous Tracking – The network provided ongoing position updates of subsea assets whenever coverage allowed, delivering consistent situational awareness across the operating area.
* Scalability – The architecture demonstrated that adding more base stations naturally expands coverage and network capacity, unlocking the path toward large-scale subsea communication grids.

“This collaboration has shown that cellular-style networks bring real value to subsea operations,” said Jin Jie Jay Poh, Vice President and Head of Unmanned Systems Business Unit, ST Engineering. “By validating this concept in Singapore waters, we are opening the door to scalable solutions for defence, commercial, and research users alike.”

The deployment represents a significant step toward persistent subsea IoT, autonomous subsea fleets, and connected underwater operations—enabling safer missions, reduced downtime, and new possibilities in offshore energy, maritime robotics, and scientific research.
