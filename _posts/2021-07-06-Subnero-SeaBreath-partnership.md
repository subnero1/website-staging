Subnero is delighted to add [SeaBreath](https://www.sea-breath.com/) to their list of business partners.

SeaBreath is based in Tokyo and will represent Subnero in Japan.

Subnero offerings are the perfect addition to their existing range of products and solutions from a number of well-known [international brands](https://www.sea-breath.com/product).

Every member of the team has several years experience in the subsea industry, which makes SeaBreath the perfect choice to grow the business in Japan.

We are really excited about this new partnership.
