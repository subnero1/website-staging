Subnero participated in its first virtual exhibition during the IEEE OES AUV 2020 symposium, which was held online from 29 September to 2 October 2020. Originally planned to take place in St John’s, Canada, the event was moved to a virtual format due to the pandemic. Despite the remote setting, the networking sessions were lively and the panel discussions engaging. We enjoyed being part of the event and look forward to attending future editions, ideally in person.
