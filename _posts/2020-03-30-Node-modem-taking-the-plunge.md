Subnero’s [Silver Edition modem](https://subnero.com/products/#smart-modems) (Node configuration) was deployed in the Mediterranean Sea as part of an academic research project.

The team led by [Roee Diamant](https://sites.google.com/edu.haifa.ac.il/anl/personnel){:target="_blank"} at the University of Haifa deployed a Subnero modem with an [additional co-processor](https://subnero.com/product-launch/feature/2018/11/17/Underwater-modem-with-a-coprocessor.html), configured to support sonar-like functionality for their research activities.
