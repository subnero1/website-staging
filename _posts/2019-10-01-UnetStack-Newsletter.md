We are now pleased to announce the release of [UnetStack3](https://unetstack.net/){:target="_blank"}.

Since the first public release of UnetStack in 2013, we have been steadily adding features and improving ease of use. UnetStack3 is a major milestone in the evolution of UnetStack. It debuts a software-defined modem that can run on your laptop or on an embedded computer.

It adds the following features:

- Unet audio, including JANUS support,
- Easy-to-use socket-style application programming interfaces (APIs),
- Support for language APIs such as Python, Javascript, C and Julia,
- Portals for transparent data transfer between applications,
- Short-circuit processing for bandwidth efficiency,
- High performance networking protocols,
- Powerful error correction codes,
- Customizable address space to optimize bandwidth usage,
- Support for QoS and DTN protocols,
- Physical-layer geotagging of frames,
- Connector framework to support TCP, UDP, and RS232 devices,
- and more...
