An acoustic modem is a device designed for underwater wireless communication using acoustic signals, typically functioning as a simple data transmitter. In contrast, an acoustic smart modem, like those from Subnero, is comparable to a smartphone. Just as a smartphone can run apps and customize its behavior for different tasks, a smart modem allows users to tailor its functionality to specific applications. It supports advanced features, such as running custom algorithms, managing multiple tasks seamlessly, and adapting to the underwater environment when needed. This flexibility makes smart modems far more versatile and capable than traditional acoustic modems.
