Subnero modems are configured to use Frequency Hopping Binary Frequency Shift Keying (FH-BFSK) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for CONTROL and DATA channels out-of-the-box, with user customization options. An auxiliary channel supports standards like JANUS and SWiGAcoustic Level 1, and a user-defined channel allows custom modulation schemes.
