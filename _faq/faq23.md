Unet audio, available as part of UnetStack3 Community Edition, converts a laptop into an acoustic modem using its built-in speaker and microphone. Freely available for non-commercial use, it helps test and develop communication protocols.

For example, you can use Unet audio to convert your laptop into a JANUS-compliant modem. For more information, refer to this [blog article and video](https://blog.unetstack.net/converting-your-laptop-into-a-janus-modem-using-unetaudio).
