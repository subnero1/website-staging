Yes, Subnero modems can interoperate with third-party devices that support standards like JANUS or SWiG Acoustic Level 1. Users can also implement custom communication algorithms for interoperability. Over the years, Subnero modems have demonstrated interoperability with various third-party modems (commercial or research variants).
