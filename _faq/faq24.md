Yes, Subnero modems can interface with various external sensors, including ADCPs, tide gauges, and CTDs, through the [Subnero Wireless Integrated Suite (SWIS)](https://subnero.com/solutions/swis). For generic streaming sensors using RS232 or Ethernet, SWIS-Connect enables seamless integration. UnetStack APIs also allow software-level or custom integrations.

For more details about custom integrations, contact us at sales@subnero.com.
