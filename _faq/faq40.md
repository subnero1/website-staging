Yes, users can develop and run their own protocols or applications on the modem as Groovy scripts or UnetStack agents written in Java or Groovy. These agents can be managed using the modemâ€™s web-based UI, which includes a fully featured file manager and editor.

For compute-intensive tasks, such as implementing a custom physical layer, Subnero modems offer the option to include an additional coprocessor, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, to handle high-demand processing requirements.
