The required battery capacity depends on several factors related to the deployment, including:
- Amount of data download
- Frequency of downloads
- Range of communication

To help estimate battery requirements, Subnero provides an online battery calculator tailored for SWIS applications, available [here](https://subnero.com/battery-calculator).

For assessments based on your deployment needs, contact us at sales@subnero.com.
