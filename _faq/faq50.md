The Subnero Wireless Integrated Suite (SWIS) - ADCP Edition is a tailored solution for the wireless transfer of data from ADCPs like Nortek’s Signature series. It uses Subnero’s WNC series of acoustic smart modems, powered by SWIS software, to overcome challenges associated with underwater acoustic communication.

Key differentiators include:
- Advanced communication algorithms that can adapt to changing environmental conditions for consistent communication.
- Seamless integration and edge intelligence that processes data at the edge for efficient, content-aware transmission.
- Intuitive user interface for data access, fault detection, and smart scheduling with minimal effort.
