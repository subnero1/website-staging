To prevent interference with other acoustic devices, you can use these methods:
1. Time Division: Schedule transmissions or use the MAC layer to avoid simultaneous operation, with the option to use an external hardware sync signal for coordination.
2. Frequency Division: Configure the modems to operate in non-overlapping frequency bands. See this blog article for details: [https://blog.unetstack.net/frequency-band-control-in-unetstack](https://blog.unetstack.net/frequency-band-control-in-unetstack)
