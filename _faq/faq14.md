The achievable throughput and communication range in ideal channel conditions are listed in the technical specifications for each Subnero modem. However, actual performance can vary significantly depending on environmental factors such as channel and noise conditions. As software-defined devices, Subnero modems allow users to dynamically trade off throughput for range or vice versa, adapting to real-time conditions to meet specific application needs effectively.
