Subnero modems include a standard 12-month warranty covering defective parts, excluding damage from accidents or user negligence. Upon receiving a modem for service, Subnero assesses and informs you about what is covered under warranty.

Warranty extensions are available through an additional service package. Repairs or major services outside this agreement are charged separately.
