If you are an OEM developer, you can license the UnetStack OEM Edition through Subnero and design your modem hardware around it. For non-commercial users, UnetStack provides tools and guidance for building your own modems using off-the-shelf components. A detailed step-by-step process can be found in this [blog article](https://blog.unetstack.net/Project-Sabine-Low-cost-DIY-underwater-modem-using-COTS-components-and-Unet-audio).

If you create a modem based on UnetStack, weâ€™d love to hear from you! Contact us at sales@subnero.com to have your project showcased on our social media channels.

For detailed information about the various editions and their applications, refer to this [UnetStack whitepaper](https://subnero.com/brochures/unlocking-underwater-connectivity.pdf).
